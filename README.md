# booklist
Web version of home library.

I have lots of books at home, so some kind of registry was strongly required. Once it was implemented in Microsoft Access, but due to problems with home PC and increasing number of computers at home I've moved it into cloud.

Project is written in Python using Django. It is hosted on Heroky and is currently available at djachenko.herokuapp.com.
